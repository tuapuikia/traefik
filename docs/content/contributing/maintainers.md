## Contributions Daily Meeting

* 3 Maintainers should attend to a Contributions Daily Meeting where we sort and label new issues ([is:issue label:status/0-needs-triage](https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Astatus%2F0-needs-triage+)), and review every Pull Requests
* Every pull request should be checked during the Contributions Daily Meeting
    * Even if it’s already assigned
    * Even PR labelled with `contributor/waiting-for-corrections` or `contributor/waiting-for-feedback`
* Issues labeled with `priority/P0` and `priority/P1` should be assigned.
* Modifying an issue or a pull request (labels, assignees, milestone) is only possible:
    * During the Contributions Daily Meeting
    * By an assigned maintainer
    * In case of emergency, if a change proposal is approved by 2 other maintainers (on Slack, Discord, Discourse, etc)

## PR review process:

* The status `needs-design-review` is only used in complex/heavy/tricky PRs.
* From `1` to `2`: 1 comment that says “design LGTM” (by a senior maintainer).
* From `2` to `3`: 3 LGTM approvals by any maintainer.
* If needed, a specific maintainer familiar with a particular domain can be requested for the review.
* If a PR has been implemented in pair programming, one peer's LGTM goes into the review for free
* Amending someone else's pull request is authorized only in emergency, if a rebase is needed, or if the initial contributor is silent

We use [PRM](https://github.com/ldez/prm) to manage locally pull requests.

## Bots

### [Myrmica Lobicornis](https://github.com/containous/lobicornis/)

Update and Merge Pull Request.

The maintainer giving the final LGTM must add the `status/3-needs-merge` label to trigger the merge bot.

By default, a squash-rebase merge will be carried out.
To preserve commits, add `bot/merge-method-rebase` before `status/3-needs-merge`.

The status `status/4-merge-in-progress` is only used by the bot.

If the bot is not able to perform the merge, the label `bot/need-human-merge` is added.  
In such a situation, solve the conflicts/CI/... and then remove the label `bot/need-human-merge`.

To prevent the bot from automatically merging a PR, add the label `bot/no-merge`.

The label `bot/light-review` decreases the number of required LGTM from 3 to 1.

This label is used when:

* Updating the vendors from previously reviewed PRs
* Merging branches into the master
* Preparing the release

### [Myrmica Bibikoffi](https://github.com/containous/bibikoffi/)

* closes stale issues [cron]
    * use some criterion as number of days between creation, last update, labels, ...

### [Myrmica Aloba](https://github.com/containous/aloba)

Manage GitHub labels.

* Add labels on new PR [GitHub WebHook]
* Add milestone to a new PR based on a branch version (1.4, 1.3, ...) [GitHub WebHook]
* Add and remove `contributor/waiting-for-corrections` label when a review request changes [GitHub WebHook]
* Weekly report of PR status on Slack (CaptainPR) [cron]

## Labels

A maintainer that looks at an issue/PR must define its `kind/*`, `area/*`, and `status/*`.

### Status - Workflow

The `status/*` labels represent the desired state in the workflow.

* `status/0-needs-triage`: all the new issues and PRs have this status. _[bot only]_
* `status/1-needs-design-review`: needs a design review. **(only for PR)**
* `status/2-needs-review`: needs a code/documentation review. **(only for PR)**
* `status/3-needs-merge`: ready to merge. **(only for PR)**
* `status/4-merge-in-progress`: merge is in progress. _[bot only]_

### Contributor

* `contributor/need-more-information`: we need more information from the contributor in order to analyze a problem.
* `contributor/waiting-for-feedback`: we need the contributor to give us feedback.
